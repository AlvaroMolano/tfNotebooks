    "# Parallel Suffixes and the Continuation of Actants in 4Q246\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there places, first in Biblical Aramaic, where a suffix in a clause identifies in person, gender, and number with a subject suffix in an immediately preceding clause, but refers to a different referent?\n",
    "\n",
    "If so: What kinds of factors allow for distinguishing between the two participants? Are there any formal indicators?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4Q246 (Aramaic)](http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q246-1), a controversial figure appears who is called ברה די אל (\"son of God\") and בר עליון (\"son of the Most High\"). Much of the material before this point (column 2 line 1) is damaged, which complicates the identification of the figure. But the material which follows the reference leaves an open question as to whether the son of God is presented as a positive or negative character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant text of the passage in question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ברה די אל יתאמר ובר עליון יקרונה <br>\n",
    "> כזיקיא חזותא כן מלכותהן תהוה <br>\n",
    "> שנין ימלכון על ארעא וכלא ידשון <br>\n",
    "> ...<br>\n",
    "> עד יקום עם אל\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "> The Son of God he will be called, and son of the Most High they will name him. <br>\n",
    "> Like the sparks/comets of the vision, thus will their kingdom be. <br>\n",
    "> Years they will reign over the land, and everyone they will trample. <br>\n",
    "> ... <br>\n",
    "> Until [the] people of God arise. (4Q246, Col 2, lns. 1-3, 5) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A major issue in interpreting the \"son of God\" figure is the identification of the 3MP \"they\" between lines 1-2. Specifically, the text says, \"...and son of the Most High **they** will name him\" and then progresses to say, \"Like the comets of the vision, thus will **their** kingdom be.\" Since the 3MP suffix on \"their kingdom\" refers to a tumultuous kingdom that ends after the people of God arise (\"until the people of God...\"), the \"son of God\" must be so named by a wicked people, that is, if the 3MP in both clauses refer to the same referent. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inventory of Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem described above, here is a set of parameters the code must find:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two contiguous clauses\n",
    "    * If clause is defective or causus pendens, it must be considered together with its last portion.\n",
    "    * Clause 1 contains a verb with PGN X\n",
    "    * Clause 2 contains a noun with a pronominal suffix with PGN X\n",
    "    * No other PGN indicators can occur between PGN reference 1 and PGN reference 2\n",
    "        * Exception: if the PGN indicator is a noun with a comparative particle such as כ inside of a causus pendens\n",
    "    \n",
    "Export results to a spreadsheet for examination. Hits will need to be manually labled as Y or N on the question: is the same referent? Include a separate row in the spreadsheet for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin first with Biblical Aramaic. If data is sparse, or if it is examined and further data is preferable, expand the search to Biblical Hebrew."
