    "During the encoding of 4Q246, an important clause connection decision must be made in clause 11 (of column II). The clause contains a 3MS suffix, for which there are two available antecedents: either \"the son of God\" in clause 1 or \"people of God\" in clause 9. Which clause is the mother will directly influence the interpretation:\n",

    "> 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xYq0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ברה די אל יתאמר &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The son of God he will be called...\"<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook resulted in inconclusive results for my research question. Even though the xYq0 connection occurs technically more often (5 vs. 0 times), the small number of results found limits the significance. Attempts to draw out additional results from the more general presence/absence of a subject proved equally inconclusive; 35 of the NmCl mother clauses contain an explicit subject (marked with 'X') while 40 have no explicit subject ('0'). This difference is hardly enough to posit any relationship between the presence/absence of a subject in the mother clause of a NmCl. -Cody, 30 April 2017"
