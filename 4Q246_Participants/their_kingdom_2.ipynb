    "## Introduction \n",
    "In the previous notebook, [their_kingdom_1.ipynb](their_kingdom_1.ipynb), a query attempted to address whether the 3MP from יקרונה (\"**they** will name him\") in col II line 1 of 4Q246 was likely to be the same 3MP in the subsequent clause, כן מלכותהן תהוה (\"thus will **their** kingdom be.\" see the image above). To do so, the query surveyed cases in the Hebrew Bible wherein the PGN markers were the same but had different referents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of 405 matches<sup>1</sup> in Biblical Hebrew, 5 instances contained a verb with an impersonal subject which led to a disconnect between the two PGN markers. 2 of those examples were due to a passive verb. Further investigation into the phenomenon of impersonal subjects in Aramaic led to the recognition that the 3MP is commonly used in such a way in Aramaic, often as a parallel to passive verbs. Those same circumstances exist in 4Q246 II.1, and that would suggest the possibility that the PGN of the verb and following pronominal suffix are not actually referring to the same referent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a situation, it is necessary to account for a new antecedent for the \"their\" of מלכותהן. One possibility is provided by J.A. Fitzmeyer, who interprets the extant phrase, מלך אתור ומצרין (\"king of Assyria and Egypt\") as a reference to *two* kings. His reconstruction of the phrase is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ולקצת יומיא יאבדון] מלך אתור [ומ]צרין] <br>\n",
    "> [And at the end of the days] the king of Assyria [and Eg]ypt [(they) will perish].<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitzmeyer's suggestion does not receive a defense or explanation. On the other hand, it offers a interpretation of the phrase מלך אתור ומצרין (\"king of Assyria and Egypt\") which could provide an apt antecedent for the pronominal suffix on מלכותהן (\"their kingdom\"). If such is the case, an additional query will search for the role of semantics in linking PGN indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Fitzmeyer's suggestion is not viable, though, it suggests some added difficulty for the positive interpretation. The lack of another extant plural subject might boost the likelihood that the antecedent of the plural 3MP of מלכותהן is the same 3MP that serves (יעבדון) the \"son of God\" (I.8), since that is the nearest alternative 3MP in the text.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr width=\"500\" align=\"left\">\n",
    "<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses matched were those with a third person verb followed by a clause with a third person, identical pronominal suffix, without interruption by another PNG marker\n",
