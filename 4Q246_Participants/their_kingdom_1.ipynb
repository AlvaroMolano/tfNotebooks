    "# The \"their\" of \"their kingdom\" In 4Q246, II.2\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/their_kingdom.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4Q246 (Aramaic)](http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q246-1), a controversial figure appears who is called ברה די אל (\"son of God\") and בר עליון (\"son of the Most High\"). Much of the material before this point (column 2 line 1) is damaged, which complicates the identification of the figure. But the material which follows the reference leaves an open question as to whether the son of God is presented as a positive or negative character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant text of the passage in question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ברה די אל יתאמר ובר עליון יקרונה <br>\n",
    "> כזיקיא חזותא כן מלכותהן תהוה <br>\n",
    "> שנין ימלכון על ארעא וכלא ידשון <br>\n",
    "> ...<br>\n",
    "> עד יקום עם אל\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "> The Son of God he will be called, and son of the Most High they will name him. <br>\n",
    "> Like the sparks/comets of the vision, thus will their kingdom be. <br>\n",
    "> Years they will reign over the land, and everyone they will trample. <br>\n",
    "> ... <br>\n",
    "> Until [the] people of God arise. (4Q246, Col 2, lns. 1-3, 5) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A major issue in interpreting the \"son of God\" figure is the identification of the 3MP \"they\" between lines 1-2. Specifically, the text says, \"...and son of the Most High **they** will name him\" and then progresses to say, \"Like the comets of the vision, thus will **their** kingdom be.\" Since the 3MP suffix on \"their kingdom\" refers to a tumultuous kingdom that ends after the people of God arise (\"until the people of God...\"), the \"son of God\" must be so named by a wicked people, that is, if the 3MP in both clauses refer to the same referent. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there places where a suffix in a clause identifies in person, gender, and number with a subject suffix in an immediately preceding clause, but refers to a different referent?\n",
    "\n",
    "If so: What factors create a separation between the two referents?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inventory of Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem described above, here is a set of parameters the code must find:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two contiguous clauses\n",
    "    * If clause is defective or causus pendens, it must be considered together with its last portion.\n",
    "    * Clause 1 contains a third person verb with PGN X\n",
    "    * Clause 2 contains a noun with a third person pronominal suffix with PGN X\n",
    "    * No other PGN indicators can occur between PGN reference 1 and PGN reference 2\n",
    "        * Exception: exceptions will be made for nouns connected to a prepositional phrase, since it is the case in 4Q246 that a noun with identical PGN markers intervenes between the verb and the pronominal suffix, but it is a comparative phrase with כ. The exception is made in the interest of finding examples as close to 4Q246 as possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Export results to a spreadsheet for examination. Hits will need to be manually labled as Y or N on the question: is the same referent? Include a separate row in the spreadsheet for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin first with Biblical Aramaic. If data is sparse, or if it is examined and further data is preferable, expand the search to Biblical Hebrew."

    "* [Aramaic](results/contiguous_suffixes_BA.csv)\n",
    "* [Hebrew](results/contiguous_suffixes_BH_Quotation.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "This query finds 5 cases (of 405) in Biblical Hebrew quotative clauses where an identical verbal subject is separated from an identical pronominal suffix in a subsequent clause due to the use of an impersonal subject by the verb. Such an impersonal subject in 4Q246 for the verb, \"they will name him\" seems likely given that the verb is parallel to a passive form and given the tendency in Aramaic for 3MP impersonal verbs to occur in parallel to a passive verb. This notebook leads to a number of additional questions which will be addressed in the follow up notebook, `4Q256_their_kingdom_2.ipynb`."

    "* **marked_discourse** - the verb and the pronominal suffix are separated by the beginning of marked discourse...the verb is thus a verb of speaking. The two referents are different.\n",

This leads him, in turn, to interpret the 3MP יקרונה as an unidentified subject that is simply in parallel to the hitpeel:\n",
    "\n",
    "> One initial reason for suspicion is the third-person masculine plural verb in ii 1 (יקרונה), which questions the notion that the previous three Ithpeel/Ithpaal forms are reflexive. It instead suggests the opposite: the figure “is named” by some unspecified subject/s throughout (discussed more below). - \"Naming the Messiah: A Contribution to the 4Q246 'Son of God' Debate,\" *Dead Sea Discoveries* 21 (2014): 165 \n",

Thus, we look more closely at the `placeholder_referent` results. These tags represent situations in which a placeholder referent, required grammatically or simply with an unspecified antecedent, requires a distinction to be made between the verb referent (the placeholder) and the pronominal suffix referent."

I know that compound subjects with plural verbs happens. How frequent is it? And what factors facilitate their identification?\n",
    "   * Do semantic factors play a role in the identification of suffix antecedents? In the case of the word \"kingdom\" (מלכות, ממלכה) with pronominal suffixes, is the antecedent frequently identified as a מלך in the preceding narrative text? That would only seem natural. But how often does it happen? \n",

    "2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The disconnect between the \"their\" of \"their kingdom\" and the \"they\" of \"they will name him\" works in favor of reading the title as a positive one. But there remain difficulties for that interpretation. For instance, those who read the title as a positive, messianic one typically read the 3MS of מלכותה (\"his kingdom\") in II.5 as a reference to the ברה די אל (\"the son of God\"); yet this is in spite of the fact that the closest 3MS noun is not the בר but the עם אל (\"people of God\"). Proponents of the negative reading insist that the scribal vacat in II.4, \" [vacat] Until the people of God arise...\" creates a separate section from the preceding material, meaning that the עם אל is not only the closest option, but the only option. Yet, the grammatical structure itself suggests that the situation is more complicated than that. Importantly, the particle עד is not known elsewhere to indicate a clean break. Rather, it is used in dependent clauses. In this case, the עד clause quite naturally should connect back to the שנין (\"years\") in II.2, \"years they will reign\" (שנין ימלכון)...\"until the people of God arise\" (עד יקום עם אל). This suggests grammatical continuity; and it also creates an embedding of the tumultuous kingdom. This again raises the possibility, since there is not a complete break, that ברה די אל (\"the son of God\") could, conceivably, serve as the antecedent of the 3MS suffix on מלכותה. This depends on:\n",
    "   * How does עד or similar temporal particles with a dependent relationship affect the inheritance of PGN information? Are there frequently identical indicators that are, in fact, separated due to the grammatical construction?\n",
