**These notebooks are in progress. This is the very beginning stages of my upcoming thesis on verbs, tense, aspect, and time indicators in biblical Hebrew. The topic and direction remain fluid.**<br><br>
The code utilises the database resources of the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer via the ETCBC4c in [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric "Text-Fabric").

Some of the notebooks in this repository will also serve for my final project for the [Python for Text Analysis](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis "PTA") course at the VU Amsterdam.
