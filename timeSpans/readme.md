# Time Spans in Genesis

This project attempts to track the influence of time markers throughout clause chains within the book of Genesis. The purpose is to explore the relationship between time indicators and the verb forms they "govern."

There are two main Jupyter notebooks in this directory. If you have never used Text-Fabric before, you should follow the order below for working through this project.

1. [Text_Fabric_Tutorial.ipynb](Text_Fabric_Tutorial.ipynb)
  * installation and setup of Text-Fabric and the ETCBC Hebrew data
2. [Time_Spans.ipynb](Time_Spans.ipynb)
  * creation and analysis of Genesis time spans

The directory also contains a visualization in html format ([Genesis_timespans.html](https://cdn.rawgit.com/codykingham/tfNotebooks/fb422cbf/timeSpans/Genesis_timespans.html)). It is built and hyperlinked within the [Time_Spans](Time_Spans.ipynb) notebook.

This project served as my final project for the [Python for Text Analysis course](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/python-for-text-analysis) at the Free University of Amsterdam in 2017.
